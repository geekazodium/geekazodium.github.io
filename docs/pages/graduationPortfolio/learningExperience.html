                The Love of Computers
            </h1>

            <p>
                computers have always been facsinating to me, this 
                magical box being able to draw awsome looking graphics 
                and do math at speeds no human can dream of.
                Later I realized that it's not magic, and as I learned more
                and more about computers, the more it has become a huge
                part of my life's meaning, to create something awsome
                with computers.

            <h2>
                learning scratch aka: my first step
            </h2>
            <p>
                I had some past failed attempts at making programs
                on computers, this was when I was in grade 6, so...
                I had no idea what I was doing, at some point I was
                introduced to scratch.mit.edu which, at the time,
                I had already been trying out coding with blocks, I
                don't have too much to show from back then, because
                I realized, most of my projects ended up incomplete,
                there was a few exceptions which I am still proud of
                to this day:
            </p>

            <p>
                however, one of the biggest things that scratch made me
                learn is something not as easy to represent in a project:
                my ability to read other people's code and try to understand
                their logic in a more intuitive sense.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Leap of overconfidence: minecraft plugin development
            </h2>
            <p>
                I really liked minecraft, I REALLY liked minecraft, I play
                that game too much and even to this day I still play minecraft
                arguably too much. I have decided to try making a jump to making
                minecraft server plugins, this went... not super great,
                turns out, I still didn't understand more advanced programming
                concepts such as OOP or even understand what an "instance" is,
                it forced me to realize I didn't know enough to make anything
                more than code that spawns tnt at the player when they right click. 
                While this didn't give me much to show
                in terms of making a final product, that's not what matters,
                because it helped me learn Java and lead up to my next big step.

            <h2>
                Heck: minecraft modification development
            </h2>
            <p> (during grade 9)
                This was a much bigger leap, I thought at
                the time, I understood coding well and was already
                very good at it, but I was wrong. I decided to learn minecraft
                modification writing using FabricMC, which was, unbeknownced
                to me, a heck of a challenge, while these two tasks seem similar
                they were, and I must <em>EMPHASIZE</em> (haha get it, the html tag
                is &lt;em&gt;) that it was very different.
            </p>
                Plugin development with bukkit:
                <ul>
                    <li>simple api</li>
                    <li>event listener model</li>
                    <li>indirect access to minecraft through api</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Modification development with FabricMC:
                <ul>
                    <li>you have to learn to read minecraft source code</li>
                    <li>you must interact with minecraft code directly</li>
                    <li>mixin(code injection) model</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                in summary, the fact that I thought I could manage that without
                any struggle was a really dumb idea. I spent way too long trying
                to make any minecraft mod, and the most I managed was some <a href="https://github.com/geekazodium/better-lang-reader">small
                projects (better lang reader)</a> that are on my github right now.
                This took me a <em>LONG</em> time to learn and while at many moments
                painful, and a reminder that I should have been more prepared,
                I still think that I would do it the same way if I needed to learn
                coding again. As learning OOP concepts on the fly by reading minecraft
                code was, in my very dumb opinion, acutally really helpful for me.
                <br><br>
                (I later learned Minecraft Forge modding as well, 
                which was much easier to learn because it was more like plugin 
                development and I also already had experience with modding which helped 
                me build a <a href="https://github.com/geekazodium/wynn-meow">funny project</a>)
            </p>
            <h4>the struggle may not have been always fun, 
                but I cared about learning coding and didn't give up, 
                in the end it definitely was worth it.

            <h2>
                Too... Easy??? Learning JS, CSS, HTML
            </h2>
            <p>
                spoilers: it really wasn't, during design technology, we were supposed to code a website using
                HTML and CSS, I thought that this would be easy, as I went in with the assumption that since
                there's no significant complexity in writing text and putting tags around the text..
            </p>
            <h4>... *pause for dramatic effect*</h6>
            <p>
                I was very wrong... while the html was intuitive on it's own, there's something else
                that causes a LOT of frustration: css(cascading style sheets).
                learning css is like rolling dice until you find the right tag to make it look like what it's
                supposed to.
                at least learning javascript was fine as they had a helpful documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                fastforward to grade 10 where we had to do another project in design tech
                related to coding websites, I was able to easily complete an extremely barebones
                rhythm games program, at that point I could have went the easy route and just turned
                that in as the project, wrote a bit of fluff as the explanation, blah blah blah make
                up a client or whatever and that would have been a "success".
            </p>
            <p>
                but I decided I didn't want to do that, instead, I decided to tackle something that
                has been confusing me for so long: 3d graphics. It's always been a facsinating to me how
                someone could program a computer to do a bunch of math and show a 3d enviornment.
            </p>
            <p> 
                so I found a client for my 3d coding project, and got to work learning the basics of
                webgl2 by watching youtube tutorials, and that mostly worked, I was able to, after a bunch
                of copying tutorials and then rewriting stuff and whatnot, I was able to code a terrain
                buffer builder and draw minecraft like terrain, well... mostly.
            </p>

                I'll spare you the details to what specifically went wrong but, needless to say, it didn't render
                the tiles correctly, and kept sampling pixels outside of the textures, creating ugly
                white lines along the edges of blocks when you were looking at the blocks at an angle.
                I found a lot of help for this by going to a discord server for graphics programming,
                and asking "what am I doing wrong", and after getting nowhere with my original approach
                of using a texture atlas, I decided to try changing how the textures are stored,
                using webgl2's new texture arrays feature, that was able to make the voxel textures 
                only sample where they're supposed to.
